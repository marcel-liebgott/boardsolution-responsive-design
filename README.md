Boardsolution
=============

Boardsolution is an open-source discussion board written in PHP, uses a MySQL
backend and is based on
[FrameWorkSolution](https://github.com/script-solution/FrameWorkSolution).
It provides everything that you would expect from a discussion board like
forums, topics, posts, polls, appointments, private messages, moderators, user
groups, a search function, a calendar, a portal, a sophisticated BBCode engine,
multiple languages, a feature-rich admin control panel and much more.
Additionally, it uses a
[BBCodeEditor](https://github.com/script-solution/BBCodeEditor) to allow the
user to write posts in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get way.  
Since it is template-based and constructed in a very modular way, it is easy to
customize and extend.

Goal
